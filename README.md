Selenium test cases on Amazon website using Python

I am in the learning process of Test Automation and this project is my first big project in Selenium. I wanted to learn by getting hands-on experiences so I have carried out 5 test on Amazon website. These test are:

Amazon home page load test
Sign up button
Login
Searching a product
Sorting products according to 'average customer rating'
*You have to enter your user information into loginInfo.py in order to run login test successfully.
